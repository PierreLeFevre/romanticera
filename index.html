		<h1>Introduction - Mary Shelley</h1>
		<h3>Phew, you made it here!</h3>
		
		<p>It seems like you wanted to learn more about what the technology and science scene looked like back in the Romantic era.</p>
		<p>As you may already know, the Romantic era, or age of reflection, was huge when it comes to scientists and intellectuals coming forward with their thoughts and discoveries.  Just as everyone was getting tired of the enlightment’s boring structure, the Romantic Era peeked its nose.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Mary Shelley</h3>
		<br><br>
	</div>
	<div class="content hideme showMeLeft" id="article2">
		<h1>Society</h1>
		<h3>The people started to move.</h3>
		<p>The urbanisation has started and people were desperate to move in to the big cities to find jobs, working on the farm was no longer profitable and the city life was the best for the family. 
		They moved to a dirty and poor city, and diseases started, this was a though period.</p>
		<p>England under this era was very poor, many people started moving in to the city and people needed jobs, so artists and writers was a good opportunity to get a job at this time. 
		People like Mary Shelley that came from a rich family had obviously better opportunities to produce books because of her father who were a philosopher.
		And could support Mary in her writing. There were people who had a harder life and who fought against diseases and just to survive.</p>
		<p>The farm that many people lived and worked at was a bad idea and the people wanted something new in their lives, so they started the urbanisation and at this moment this was in full movement as everyone wanted to live in the cities.
		As I mentioned before this was a hard time and there was problems finding jobs so people had so much spare time to do what they wanted, and with all creativity they could create art. 
		The theatre under this era was about emotions and what people had experienced in their lives, It was all about good things and never about taboo things like sex and dead bodies for example.</p>
		<p>The theatre was not the biggest in literature at this moment, because it was so many who read novels because that was the biggest around.
		To round up this text, the romantic period was a bad time for the people who struggled a lot, the rich was the ones who ruled and had the power. 
		The urbanisation was in its full movement and the big cities started to form, the life on the farms was no longer an option if you wanted to survive.</p>

		<h1>Science</h1>
		<h3>What characterizes the Romantic Era in science?</h3>
		<p>As the name states, during the Romantic Era, people romanticized things to no end. The Technology and Science scene was no different. The largest difference between the Enlightment era with its knowledge-based research, and the Romantic Era with its more organic approach to research with a huge emphasis on the whole of things, rather than the nitty-gritty stuff.<br><br>
		Another idea advanced by Romanticism is the emphasis on the scientists, as at that time, it was believed that the amount of knowledge that the scientist had about the subject added value to the research, as it meant that more could be understood and more information could be collected and used. This movement within the science scene originated from Friedrich Schelling’s “Naturphilosophie”.<br>
		In countries like Great Britain and Germany, the focus of most scientists changed from researching the more obvious, physical things, to understanding the human intelligence and its capacities.<br><br></p>
		
		<h3>What parts of the Romantic science are still relevant today?</h3>
		<p>“Why should I care”, you may ask. Well, when looking at what the researchers achieved at the time, it is actually quite impressive how much of their discoveries and further developing of existing topics are still used and actively researched about.<br>
		These topics include Biology, Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, and Chemistry.<br>
		Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was first to invent the Romantic take on Biology in 1801, which he affectionately referred to as “an independent scientific discipline […] consisting in a spreading awareness that […] living nature cannot be understood […] (by) the laws of physics”.<br>
		At the time, the study of organic, living organisms was a new concept, which, as stated earlier, was rather revolutionary at the time. It sparked the interest in creating and working on loads of other scientific movements, like Goethe’s color science, and organic chemist
		Most also believe that the structure of mathematics as we know them was defined during the Romantic era. Before, it was known as a logical, intuitive method to solve problems, but it was during the Romantic era that the boundaries were stretched, to the point where math became what it is known for now, theoretical and philosophical, rather than logic.<br><br>

		To wrap up, the Romantic Era was a huge part of creating the scientific grounds for the discoveries of today, with most of today’s large research topics originating from the era.<br><br>

		<h1>Role of Women</h1>
		<h3>Was women even important?</h3>
		<p>
		  The Romantic Era was a time of complete social and political upheaval. While today the divide that exists between men and women is slowly disappearing, during the late 18th century and early 19th century the position of women was subordinate to that of men.


		During the late 18th century and early 19th century men and women were socially and legally expected to behave to a seperate standard . While the rigorously contested shift from male supremacy to complete gender equality began in this Era it was by by no means achieved.

		The Romantic woman was pure and expected to live up to be the ideal women concept with the ‘Christian family model’ that regulated women of every class to the home and kitchen. This was seen as more acceptable then the alternative. Many authors of the time wrote under male pen names so that their work wouldn't be unfairly criticized because of their gender. Examples of this is the Brontë sisters of the UK that wrote their work under male names during the Romantic Era. A woman's loss of virginity before marriage was totally unacceptable and became an outcast from the society.


		The law of the 19th century viewed married couple as one. However the individual rights and responsibilities of each member were greatly unequal.
		As examples the women were expected to obey their husband who at this time had the legal right to demand his wife. All income of the wife went straight to her husband and any property that the woman brought to the marriage became property of the man. Before marriage the family of the wife would pay a sum of money to the husband for taking her, objectifying women. Women also didn't have any legal custody over their children.

		Throughout the Romantic Era the gender roles of the women in society had greatly changed. Previously only known for their abilities in the home, women throughout the industrial revolution began to work outside the home. Although their rights were transferred to their husbands upon marriage, the small changes in this era began the long struggle for equality which is still going today.

		<h1>Music</h1>
	<h3>Romantic Era Music and Art in England</h3>
	     <p> With a bigger focus on the Art aspect. </p>
	  	  <h3> Music </h3>
		<p>The music during the Romantic era became a lot more emotional and dramatic; it also expanded into philosophical themes.<br> Music written during this time could have had a meaning of revolting against the political and social norm during the previous time (The Age of Enlightment)</p>
			<p>While there were most famous composers during this era, this article will have a focus on the English composers.</p>
		<p>The music during the romantic period had two major figures those being </p>

		<p> <h3>John Field born 1782-1837</h3>  </p>
		     <p> John Field was a composer of the Romantic Era. He was born in Dublin, when his family moved to London. He decided to try promoting his musical talents. He managed to polish his talents by studying under Muzio Clementi for six years. <br>He did not just study under Clementi he also worked in his factory while being the apprentice of Clementi.<p>
		John Fields most notable work is Nocturne, which is a composition which is inspired by the night (hence the name of Nocturne) the way nocturne is made it has the feeling of being tranquil and often very gloomy.
		Muzio Celmenti born 1752 - 1832<p>
		<p>Muzio was one of the major figures during the romantic period in the world of music. . He was the composer of piano music, chamber music, as well as symphonies.</p> they also did concerts in notable cities as Paris and St. Petersburg.</p>
		<p> Clementi’s most notable work is the fact that he changed the way you could play piano as he was noted to be the first to create the compositions capable of expressing the entire capabilities</p>
		<p> His works were often made as Piano sonata (which is works made for solo piano players) and he made around 100 of them, while other composers might have been more famous than Clementi his work was considered a lot harder to play than those made of Mozart.</p>


		That is a small bit about the music of the romantic period. In the next part of the article, I am going to talk about the art during romantic period
	</div>
	<div class="content hideme showMeLeft" id="article6">
		<h1>Art</h1>
		    <p> One of the bigger art forms that you could find during the Romantic period is Marine art.</p>
		<p> Marine art became quite big during the romantic era because travel by ship became a lot more common and the fact that England had quite the geographical form to make just marine art <br>(considering England is an island with a lot of water around it)
		<p>Marine art has a big focus on the marine side of the world with a big focus on the ships and the sea; you could put them into three different categories of styles wich are : </p>

		<p> <h3> Portraits with focus on the Ships </h3> is a style focused on ships, they were popular throughout the Romantic era. Ship portraits were, as stated by the name, focused entirely on the ship, rather than on the surrounding sea, <br> although the best known of the ship portraitists strove to carry out the full potential of the surrounding area
		    </p>
		<h3>Paintings of ships at sea. </h3> <p>This category is a bit different from the others because usually when you made these paintings you used either small boats or big vessels.</p>
		 <p> A major thing about the two different ship sizes is that they were made depending on the surrounding area, which means that if it was a smaller area they could not make the ships big because it would not capture all the details then.</p>
		     It depended more on the area they were in, as they wanted to capture the entire area in full detail.  Some artist choose to be on board the ship while painting the ships while at sea, the artist would usually travel alongside explorers.</p>

		<p>Other artist would stay on the coast, which meant they would capture less big ships and more fishing boats and the life of them instead of the bigger explorer vessels </p>

		<h3>Inshore</h3> <p> were often paintings of smaller vessels as it was harder for bigger ships to be close to shore. These were more common than paintings of large ships at sea because they only required a <br>smaller ship with a shore to make while the bigger ships usually required you to be on open sea or at harbors. </p>
		<p> They would also be cheaper because they did not require the same amount of time as the other ones did which caused them to be a bit <br> more popular during the romantic era
