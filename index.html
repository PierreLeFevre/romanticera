		<h1>Introduction - Mary Shelley</h1>
		<h3>Phew, you made it here!</h3>
		
		<p>It seems like you wanted to learn more about what the technology and science scene looked like back in the Romantic era.</p>
		
		<h3>What are the characteristics of the Romantic Era?</h3>
		<p>As should be rather obvious, during the Romantic Era, things were romanticized as far as humanly possible. 
		Romanticism originated from the ruins of the Age of Enlightenment and the Industrial revolution. Just as the society was reaching our “modern enough”-seal, the Romantic Era kicked in.

		The point of romanticizing texts, plays and other cultural works was to bring back up the morale of people, as it stagnated at an all-time-low because of the boring and work/development-focused Industrial revolution. As William Wordsworth said it: “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings”. Originality suddenly became the key to success, with a huge emphasis on women and children. This was also the first time that human ideals were stretched beyond what is naturally possible, as writers constantly tried to be the most sensual kid on the block.

		The etymology behind the word “Romanticism” is still unclear. Many argue that it comes from the latin “roman”, even though it only commonly became popular centuries later.</p>

		<h3>Who are the main authors? Major works?</h3>
		<p>Some of the main authors from the period are:
		Jane Austen
		British writer who published major works like:
			-    Sense and sensibility	(1811)
			-    Pride and Prejudice	(1813)
			-    Mansfield Park		(1814)
			-    Emma			(1816)


		William Blake
		Mostly unrecognized but massively popular writer who created works for the church:


		Lord Byron
			-    Writer of poems like Don Juan or Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage
			-    Father of the first ever programmer: Ada Lovelace



		Edgar Allan Poe
		Hugely popular literary critic and poem writer from Boston, MA, USA
		Mary Shelley ⮧

		The Romantic Period has much of the literature history such as Mary Shelley famous art “Frankenstein's monster” The novel was released in 1818 and is one of the most famous novels of all time and very popular until this day. Some of the biggest names in today's literature wrote in the Romantic Period, As i said Mary Shelley is a very big one there is also other people like William blake who wrote The Marriage Of Heaven And Hell and The Tyger. 

		Mary was born on the 30th of August in 1797 and she married the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1816 and her time of death was the 1st of February 1851. She died to brain cancer, in London, England. At the age of 24 she worked so hard to support her family, the novels she published was “Valpberga” and “The Last Man”. 

		Frankenstein's Monster was released in 1818, and is about a monster creator named Victor Frankenstein, and the monster was 8 ft tall but had emotions like a real human and just wanted to fit in. This was the beginning of the gothic genre in literature and it became very big at the time. Not everyone wrote about the gothic genre though.

		Mary`s parents were philosophers and she was born in an wealthy family, unfortunately her mom died several days after she was born so her dad had full responsibility all her life, and they were very close. Her father was William Godwin and he was a famous philosopher, her mother Mary Wollstonecraft was also a very famous feminist.</p>








		<p>“It has seemed to me—and on such an evening, I have felt it,—that this world, endowed as it is outwardly with endless shapes and influences of beauty and enjoyment, is peopled also in its spiritual life by myriads of loving spirits; from whom, unawares, we catch impressions, which mould our thoughts to good, and thus they guide beneficially the course of events, and minister to the destiny of man. Whether the beloved dead make a portion of this holy company, I dare not guess; but that such exists, I feel." this is a poem from one of her last books called “In rambles in Germany and Italy “ , The meaning of this poem is to show the suffering she went through in her life as she was forced a lot of the time to write books because she really needed to get some money to be able to support a revolutionist called Fernando which she addmired a lot. Mareys books usually had political sides to it as her mother was a feminist and she took that into her works later on in her life.</p><br>    

		<p>In this book you can really see the fact that she wants to write what she has in her heart but instead, not wanting to disrupt the flow of the book ( wanting to keep it a travel book which most of her works are ).   Considering that this book is based on her own life traveling through Italy and Germany.  I think that by this poem you can clearly see that she is trying to get things she thought about while traveling but tried to do it in a way so it doesn't affect the book is written.</p><br>

		<p>I think that more people should read this just because of the fact that she tried to write the book from her feelings while still trying to get some sort of income from the book. Her works are very good to read as they will give  you a lot more insight on how other people had it during the romantic era. You will also get to know a lot about different places as her works are most Travel books which is a great thing as being knowledgeable about different places is a good trait to have. While she might not be the most famous author i think that people can still learn a lot of things from her.</p><br>

		<h1>Society</h1>
		<h3>The people started to move.</h3>
		<p>The urbanisation has started and people were desperate to move in to the big cities to find jobs, working on the farm was no longer profitable and the city life was the best for the family. 
		They moved to a dirty and poor city, and diseases started, this was a though period.</p>
		<p>England under this era was very poor, many people started moving in to the city and people needed jobs, so artists and writers was a good opportunity to get a job at this time. 
		People like Mary Shelley that came from a rich family had obviously better opportunities to produce books because of her father who were a philosopher.
		And could support Mary in her writing. There were people who had a harder life and who fought against diseases and just to survive.</p>
		<p>The farm that many people lived and worked at was a bad idea and the people wanted something new in their lives, so they started the urbanisation and at this moment this was in full movement as everyone wanted to live in the cities.
		As I mentioned before this was a hard time and there was problems finding jobs so people had so much spare time to do what they wanted, and with all creativity they could create art. 
		The theatre under this era was about emotions and what people had experienced in their lives, It was all about good things and never about taboo things like sex and dead bodies for example.</p>
		<p>The theatre was not the biggest in literature at this moment, because it was so many who read novels because that was the biggest around.
		To round up this text, the romantic period was a bad time for the people who struggled a lot, the rich was the ones who ruled and had the power. 
		The urbanisation was in its full movement and the big cities started to form, the life on the farms was no longer an option if you wanted to survive.</p>

		<h1>Science</h1>
		<h3>What characterizes the Romantic Era in science?</h3>
		<p>As the name states, during the Romantic Era, people romanticized things to no end. The Technology and Science scene was no different. The largest difference between the Enlightment era with its knowledge-based research, and the Romantic Era with its more organic approach to research with a huge emphasis on the whole of things, rather than the nitty-gritty stuff.<br><br>
		Another idea advanced by Romanticism is the emphasis on the scientists, as at that time, it was believed that the amount of knowledge that the scientist had about the subject added value to the research, as it meant that more could be understood and more information could be collected and used. This movement within the science scene originated from Friedrich Schelling’s “Naturphilosophie”.<br>
		In countries like Great Britain and Germany, the focus of most scientists changed from researching the more obvious, physical things, to understanding the human intelligence and its capacities.<br><br></p>
		
		<h3>What parts of the Romantic science are still relevant today?</h3>
		<p>“Why should I care”, you may ask. Well, when looking at what the researchers achieved at the time, it is actually quite impressive how much of their discoveries and further developing of existing topics are still used and actively researched about.<br>
		These topics include Biology, Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, and Chemistry.<br>
		Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was first to invent the Romantic take on Biology in 1801, which he affectionately referred to as “an independent scientific discipline […] consisting in a spreading awareness that […] living nature cannot be understood […] (by) the laws of physics”.<br>
		At the time, the study of organic, living organisms was a new concept, which, as stated earlier, was rather revolutionary at the time. It sparked the interest in creating and working on loads of other scientific movements, like Goethe’s color science, and organic chemist.</p>
		<p>Most also believe that the structure of mathematics as we know them was defined during the Romantic era. Before, it was known as a logical, intuitive method to solve problems, but it was during the Romantic era that the boundaries were stretched, to the point where math became what it is known for now, theoretical and philosophical, rather than logic.<br><br>

		To wrap up, the Romantic Era was a huge part of creating the scientific grounds for the discoveries of today, with most of today’s large research topics originating from the era.<br><br>

		<h1>Role of Women</h1>
		<h3>Was women even important?</h3>
		<p>
		  The Romantic Era was a time of complete social and political upheaval. While today the divide that exists between men and women is slowly disappearing, during the late 18th century and early 19th century the position of women was subordinate to that of men. <br><br>


		During the late 18th century and early 19th century men and women were socially and legally expected to behave to a seperate standard . While the rigorously contested shift from male supremacy to complete gender equality began in this Era it was by by no means achieved.<br><br>

		The Romantic woman was pure and expected to live up to be the ideal women concept with the ‘Christian family model’ that regulated women of every class to the home and kitchen. This was seen as more acceptable then the alternative. Many authors of the time wrote under male pen names so that their work wouldn't be unfairly criticized because of their gender. Examples of this is the Brontë sisters of the UK that wrote their work under male names during the Romantic Era. A woman's loss of virginity before marriage was totally unacceptable and became an outcast from the society.<br><br>


		The law of the 19th century viewed married couple as one. However the individual rights and responsibilities of each member were greatly unequal.<br><br>
		As examples the women were expected to obey their husband who at this time had the legal right to demand his wife. All income of the wife went straight to her husband and any property that the woman brought to the marriage became property of the man. Before marriage the family of the wife would pay a sum of money to the husband for taking her, objectifying women. Women also didn't have any legal custody over their children.<br><br>

		Throughout the Romantic Era the gender roles of the women in society had greatly changed. Previously only known for their abilities in the home, women throughout the industrial revolution began to work outside the home. Although their rights were transferred to their husbands upon marriage, the small changes in this era began the long struggle for equality which is still going today.<br><br>

	<h3>Romantic Era Music and Art in England</h3>
	  	  <h3>Music</h3>
		<p>The music during the Romantic era became a lot more emotional and dramatic; it also expanded into philosophical themes.<br> Music written during this time could have had a meaning of revolting against the political and social norm during the previous time (The Age of Enlightment)</p>

		<h3>John Field born 1782-1837</h3>
		
		 <p>John Field was a composer of the Romantic Era. He was born in Dublin, when his family moved to London. He decided to try promoting his musical talents. He managed to polish his talents by studying under Muzio Clementi for six years. <br>He did not just study under Clementi he also worked in his factory while being the apprentice of Clementi.<p>
		John Fields most notable work is Nocturne, which is a composition which is inspired by the night (hence the name of Nocturne) the way nocturne is made it has the feeling of being tranquil and often very gloomy.

		<h3>Muzio Clementi born 1752 - 1832</h3>
		<p>Muzio was one of the major figures during the romantic period in the world of music. . He was the composer of piano music, chamber music, as well as symphonies.</p>They also did concerts in notable cities as Paris and St. Petersburg.</p>
		<p>Clementi’s most notable work is the fact that he changed the way you could play piano as he was noted to be the first to create the compositions capable of expressing the entire capabilities</p>
		<p>His works were often made as Piano sonata (which is works made for solo piano players) and he made around 100 of them, while other composers might have been more famous than Clementi his work was considered a lot harder to play than those made of Mozart.</p>

		<h1>Art</h1>
		    <p> One of the bigger art forms that you could find during the Romantic period is Marine art.</p>
		<p> Marine art became quite big during the romantic era because travel by ship became a lot more common and the fact that England had quite the geographical form to make just marine art <br>(considering England is an island with a lot of water around it)
		<p>Marine art has a big focus on the marine side of the world with a big focus on the ships and the sea; you could put them into three different categories of styles wich are : </p>

		<p> <h3> Portraits with focus on the Ships </h3> is a style focused on ships, they were popular throughout the Romantic era. Ship portraits were, as stated by the name, focused entirely on the ship, rather than on the surrounding sea, <br> although the best known of the ship portraitists strove to carry out the full potential of the surrounding area
		    </p>
		<h3>Paintings of ships at sea. </h3> <p>This category is a bit different from the others because usually when you made these paintings you used either small boats or big vessels.</p>
		 <p> A major thing about the two different ship sizes is that they were made depending on the surrounding area, which means that if it was a smaller area they could not make the ships big because it would not capture all the details then.</p>
		     It depended more on the area they were in, as they wanted to capture the entire area in full detail.  Some artist choose to be on board the ship while painting the ships while at sea, the artist would usually travel alongside explorers.</p>

		<p>Other artist would stay on the coast, which meant they would capture less big ships and more fishing boats and the life of them instead of the bigger explorer vessels </p>

		<h3>Inshore</h3> <p> were often paintings of smaller vessels as it was harder for bigger ships to be close to shore. These were more common than paintings of large ships at sea because they only required a <br>smaller ship with a shore to make while the bigger ships usually required you to be on open sea or at harbors. </p>
		<p> They would also be cheaper because they did not require the same amount of time as the other ones did which caused them to be a bit <br> more popular during the romantic era</p>
